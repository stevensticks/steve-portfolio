			<h2>The Unspoken Story</h2>
			<p>About ten years ago, in a Peterborough coffee shop, I was having a discussion about music. It was with an old acquaintance, James, I told him that I thought the entire genre of Rap music sucked (I know! I would kick my 22 year old self in the ass as well). His response has stuck with me ever since. He argued that there is no such thing as a bad genre of music. That if you dig into any form of music you will find great music. Being too busy listening to Radiohead and artists from the Garden State Soundtrack at the time, I probably thought this statement was total bullshit. </p>

			<p>Fast Forward to present and those are words that I try to live by. In the same breath I will tell you that I love “Red Clay Halo” by Gillian Welsh, “Tammy’s Song (Her Evils) by Kendrick Lamar and “The Guns Of Brixton” by The Clash equally. The First being a upbeat twangy Bluegrass tune, followed by a bizarre synth-y slow tempo Rap track and finished with a Reggae inspired Punk song. At first glance these songs couldn’t be spread further apart over the music spectrum but the more I listen the more I find similarities. Strip away the Synths, Basses, Guitars, Drums and Drum Machines and what you come out with is: Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus. A Pop song. There is nothing wrong with the Pop song. I love it. I embrace it. The amount of emotion, mood and feeling that an artist manages to put into those 2.5 to 5 minutes is remarkable. (1)</p>

			<p>With these thoughts in mind I bought a record that fits into none of these categories, a jazz record. Not just any Jazz record, one that is considered not only to be one of the best albums in its genre but one of the finest albums there is. Charles Mingus’, “The Black Saint and The Sinner Lady. I have heard Jazz music many times throughout my life, it can be found everywhere but it has never been a form of music that I have actively sought out. In all honesty it hard for me not to picture Flanders’ parents when I think of a typical Jazz fan but I’m trying to shed some of my past pretences.</p>

			<p>On the surface this record has nothing that I look for when I listen to music. There are no lyrics. No choruses or verses, in fact, no structure whatsoever. I will tell you have what it does have though, emotion, mood and feeling. This record is bursting at the seams with it. In its free flowing, doesn’t seem to have an idea where it’s heading next form, it manages to pull you right in by the heart.  This may be Charles Mingus’ record but each bang of the drum, each blast from a trumpet and each hammer of the piano is one these players putting as much their soul into this record as he must have. It’s captivating. It may also have to do with the fact that although there are four tracks on this record, there is not four songs on this record. This is an album that is one 39 minute song and its impossible to turn off a great song. (2)</p>

			<p>The one other thing that I have to mention about this album is that there may not be a single word sung or spoken on here but there most definitely a story here. Whether it is a piano or trumpet line that reappears from time to time to give a possible setting or the oddly out of place Spanish guitar that presents itself at times in this Sinatra-esque New York sounding album, I can only imagine that this is here as reference to some character that has its role in the story. I’m not going to try and tell you what it is because I don’t know if I totally grasp it but it’s hard to ignore. Like all the great storytellers, from Cash to Springsteen to Cave, it has the elements of a great story: Romance, Celebration, Conflict and ultimately a Resolution. It is truly a beautiful thing to listen to. </p>

			<p>This is by no means my way of saying that I’m going to burn all my “Pop” records and start a new collection of exclusively Jazz records but as a music lover this record sits beautifully alongside the rest of records in my collection.</p>

			<h1> * * *</h1>
			<p>(1) I know that I am painting with a broad brush here. All of these musicians have gone beyond the typical song structure to create something that isn’t as easy to classify as a pop song</p>

			<p>(2) I would compel any one reading this to put the album on and after 5 minutes of it being on, try and turn it off. It’s almost impossible.</p>
