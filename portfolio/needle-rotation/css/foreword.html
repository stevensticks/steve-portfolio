			<h2>Forward</h2>
			<p>There was this thing that I wrote at the end of 2009, it was a list of things that I had enjoyed that year. It was a fun little piece of writing, something to share with friends.

			The reason I bring this up is because that was the last thing that I can remember writing. <b>5 YEARS AGO!</b> I used to write all the time, usually nothing I’d ever post on the internet or show to anyone. Just something I would do for fun and practice. So I feel like it’s time to write again.

			About what? 

			I had this idea a couple months ago, an ambitious goal, starting in 2015 I’m going to buy one album a week. Not just any album but an album from a specific year. I figured there is fifty-two weeks in a year and if I subtract 52 from 2015 I am at 1963. So the first week of 2015 I buy an album from 1963, second week from 1964 and so on until I buy an album from 2015 on the last week of 2015. 

			That in itself is a pretty decent project but then I thought to myself, how about you write about it. Write about it how? 

			I have no desire to review these albums, there is nothing new I can say about these albums that hasn’t been said a million times. Also I have grown tired of “Graded Music Reviewing” as it all boils down to one persons opinion of a particular album. 

			How about a personal approach to the music? How a particular album (or just the year) has affected my life… I like it. I do realize that 1963-83 are going to be a tough 20 years because I didn’t exist yet but I have some ideas for those years.

			I’m going to leave you with two things. A little list of some of the albums I enjoyed this past year and a quote that I heard recently from one of my favourite musicians that I found inspiring. </p>
